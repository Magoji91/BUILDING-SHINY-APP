# BUILDING-SHINY-APP

Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web applications (apps) straight from R. 

Shiny apps have two components:

I-) User interface (UI.R) script: controls the layout and appearance of the app.
II-) Server script (server.R): give the instructions that R programming needs to build the app.
